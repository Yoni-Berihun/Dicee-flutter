
# Dicee Flutter App ðŸŽ²

A simple dice rolling app built with **Flutter**. Tap the dice to roll and get random numbers between 1 and 6. This project is perfect for beginners to learn **Stateful widgets**, **setState()**, **GestureDetector**, and **asset management** in Flutter.

## Features

- Roll two dice by tapping on them
- Random dice numbers from 1 to 6
- Dynamic image updates using string interpolation
- Clean and simple UI with padding and expanded widgets

## Key Concepts for Beginners

* **StatefulWidget**: Used for widgets that change over time. The dice values change when tapped, so we need a StatefulWidget.
* **setState()**: Notifies Flutter that the UI needs to be rebuilt with updated data.
* **GestureDetector**: Detects taps on images so the dice can act like buttons.
* **Expanded**: Makes dice share the available horizontal space equally.
* **Image.asset**: Loads images from the `images/` folder.
* **Random().nextInt(6) + 1**: Generates random numbers between 1 and 6, simulating dice rolls.
